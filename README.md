### Development Notes:

#### Terminology:

**sf::Texture:** holds raw pixel data on the GPU  
**sf::Sprite:** a game object on or off screen associated with a texture and transformation  
**AnimSprite:** an sf::Sprite with helper functions to set which subsprite is set. Can be easily animated  

#### Merging:

* Main should always compile
* Main should always have all the required resources in `./res` to run
